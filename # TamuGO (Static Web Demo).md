# TamuGO (Static Web Demo)

⚠️ Note: AI generation features are disabled in the public demo to protect API credentials.
They run locally in development mode.

A static HTML/CSS/JS version of the TamuGO UI (converted from React) using:
- Tailwind CDN
- Lucide Icons CDN
- Gemini API (caption + strategy)
- Imagen API (optional image generation)
- Gemini TTS (optional)

## Setup
1) Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2) Paste your API key in `config.js`
3) Open `index.html` in browser

> `config.js` is ignored by git to protect your key.
